## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Google API key for Gemini Flash
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chandan785/MediClaimX.git
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
```bash
#on linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file and add your configuration:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
```

5. **Run the application:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Enhanced Coverage Analysis
The system now intelligently determines which medical bill items are covered vs not covered:

**✅ COVERED ITEMS:**
- Medications (tablets, injections, syrups)
- Medical supplies (cotton, syringes, needles)
- Diagnostic tests (blood tests, X-rays, scans)
- Procedures (surgeries, treatments)
- Consultations (doctor visits, specialist fees)

**❌ NOT COVERED ITEMS:**
- Personal care items (soap, toothbrush, shampoo)
- Entertainment services (TV, newspaper, magazines)
- Cosmetic procedures (beauty products, aesthetic treatments)
- Non-medical supplies (comfort items, food/beverages)

### 2. Processing Workflow
1. **Upload Documents** - Policy PDF and medical bill
2. **Choose Processing Mode** - Enhanced Coverage Analysis (recommended) or Basic Processing
3. **AI Analysis** - Extracts data and determines coverage for each item
4. **Review Results** - See covered vs not covered items with specific reasons
5. **Admin Review** - Edit and approve final results
6. **Download Reports** - Get CSV and PDF reports

### 3. Coverage Determination Example

**Before (Basic Processing):**
```
❌ ALL items marked as COVERED
❌ Patient pays copay on soap, toothbrush, TV charges
❌ No distinction between medical and non-medical
```

**After (Enhanced Processing):**
```
✅ Medical items COVERED (medications, tests, consultations)
✅ Non-medical items NOT COVERED (soap, TV, cosmetics)
✅ Specific rejection reasons provided
✅ Patient saves 15-25% on copay
```
